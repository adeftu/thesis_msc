This thesis would not have been possible without the support of Eric
M{\"u}ller of 1\&1~Internet~AG. I wish to take this opportunity to express to
express my sincere gratitude to my advisor, Jan Griebsch who offered invaluable
assistance and guidance throughout all the work performed inside the company. In
addition, I would like to thank Stefan Demharter, also from 1\&1 Internet AG,
for useful insights on this project. Last but not least I thank Alin Murarasu
for his constant support, help and motivation during my whole study period at
TUM.
