In the current context of increasingly popular distributed data stores,
replication and database partitioning are fundamental approaches to achieve
load balancing, scalability, and fault tolerance. However, this comes at the
cost of synchronization between different replicas of some mutable shared object
in order to maintain them consistent. \textit{Conflict-free Replicated Data
Types} (CRDTs) define new concepts to alleviate this problem. Provided that some
simple mathematical properties hold, CRDTs ensure eventual consistency, such
that replicas converge to a common state, equivalent to a correct sequential
execution without foreground synchronization.

This thesis studies the applicability of this model with the focus on a
particular CRDT, a \textit{set} data type. An efficient algorithm for sending
deltas of updates between replicas and a specification for partitioning a set
replica into disjunctive subsets are introduced. Additionally, to cope with the
problem of database increase in size, a garbage collection mechanism to reclaim
obsolete elements from the set is discussed. This does not invalidate the CRDT
properties. Lastly, the thesis shows design and implementation of a
proof-of-concept client library for this data structure.
